As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by you (the user) are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. A link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers (known to me) used by the app are -: Google Play Services (https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)

I want to inform you that whenever you use this Service, in case of an error in the app data is collected and information (through third-party products) on your device called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing this Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. The crash report can be submitted by you if necessary.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will try to fix it/help you.
